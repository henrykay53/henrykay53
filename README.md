Hi there, I am Kolawole Henry.
I am a budding web developer intrested in creating beautiful but functional web appllications, I am currently learnig front-end technologies.
Current technologies I work with are HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript.
I am open to collaborating with fellow front end developers to challenge and up my skills, hopefully through said collaborations I will add value as well.
Feel free to reach me via email @ henrykay53@gmail.com or on twitter as @JustHenryKay.

Looking forward to hearing from fellow developers out there.
